                    I met the first ghost in front of my house. He told me it was Hyakki Night, the night of ghosts, and
                    I would meet more of them that night. I didn't believe him at first, but then I found he was right.
                    I saw the Hyakki night that night. Most ghosts were moving really fast, the lights in their hands
                    flashed by my eyes, and made me felt dizzy.<br><br>
                    One of the ghosts was quite strange, he moved really slowly. He said all ghosts have only one goal:
                    to make up for the things that they regret while they lived. I was curious why don't they just make
                    them up while they are still alive. He didn't answer me, after a while, he said we could only
                    recognize those regrets after we die.<br><br>
                    Nothing is crazy if you are in love, she said. When she said that, she was kind of crazy. I gave her
                    a cigarette and asked her does she regret what she's done, she answered me she doesn't smoke, but
                    she took that cigarette and left me in a hurry.<br><br>
                    I like drinking water since she left me. But I'm not going to find her. I want to see if I'm going
                    to regret that or not after I die, after I become a ghost. I didn't see the moonlight that night. I
                    used to think the moon eclipsed with a pattern, then I found that's not true. The moon changes with
                    its mood. I didn't want to walk anymore so I went back home.<br>
